# Robot-Arm

This is the initial CAD and code for the arm on the roTechnic YouTube Channel.

This is a work in progress and is provided as a basis for future work or for people to explore the ideas that I have used.

WARNING: This is very much a work in progress. Things will change, there are no instructions, printing of these designs may result in a rip in spacetime etc etc.

That being said, please dive in and have a look, it's a great little arm! Good Luck!
